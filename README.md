# easySoundboard
## A simple, easy to configure soundboard written in Python.

easySoundboard is my attempt at making a soundboard that is:
1. Easy to configure.
2. Extremely lightweight.
3. I can't think of a 3rd point, so just imagine that this is a good one.

### Features
* Basically none, lol.

### Configuration
1. Add your sound to the sounds folder.
2. Add it to sounds.json, like this:
```json
{
    "sound1": "test.mp3",
    "sound2": "anothersound.wav"
}
```

### How to use
It's pretty simple to use. If you wanted to play, for example, sound1 in the JSON file, you would press the "1" key on your keyboard's number row (or whatever it's called.)

#### To-Do
1. Allow rebinding sounds
2. Allow more than 9 sounds
3. Be good at programming

I apologize if this is a terribly written / unneeded program, I just made it for myself and felt like sharing it with the world.
